# Bank Loan Report

In this SQL project I integrated with Tableau and Excel. This project lead the bank to take data driven decision to enhance the Banking system as well as with the Bank loan process. 

This is a project where the Bank can take the data driven decision. The visualization helps to take to determine the Month To Date (MTD) and Month Over Month (MoM) trends and difference. 

KPI's
--------------------------
1) Total Loan Applications: This indicates the number of loan applications bank receives MTD and MoM. 
2) Total Funded Amount : Indicates the amount bank funded as loan over MTD and MoM. 
3) Total Amount Received: This KPI indicates the amount that bank received after the funded amount over MTD and MoM. 
4) Avg Interest Rate: This KPI represents the rate bank get back as the interest over MTD and MoM. 
5) Avg DTI: Debt-To-Income (DTI) represents the income level of applicants. This KPI help better to understand the financial condition of the applicant and bank can take decision to grant or declined the loan application. 

There are also some others chats and visualization to get the right information of Good Loans and Bad loans.
